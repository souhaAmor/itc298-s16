Final Project
-------------

Through course assignments you will build a full-featured list management application, using the technologies covered in class. 

You are free to choose the list topic, but some common lists are:

- To-do or tasks
- Contacts
- Books or DVD's
- Music playlist
- Shopping

Whatever the topic, your application will allow a user to perform key tasks:

- Create, Update or Delete an item
- View all items
- Filter items
- Search for items
